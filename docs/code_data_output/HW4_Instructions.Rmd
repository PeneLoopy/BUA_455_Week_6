## Instructions

### HW 4 - First Steps

**`0.`** You are encouraged to work with others and and experiment with sharing code (.Rmd files), but each student should create their own project and .Rmd file to submit.

**`1.`** Create an R project named **`HW 4 <first name> <last name>`**
   
**`2.`** Create a folder in your R project labeled **`code_data_output`**.

- Save these three .csv files to your code data output folder:
  - `bls_unemp_rate.csv`
  - `bls_import_index.csv` 
  - `bls_export_index.csv` 

3.  Download the provided file, **[`HW4_Template.Rmd`]()** and change the title to be HW 4.

- Change file name to be **`HW4_FirstName_LastName.Rmd`**

  - For example, I would change the template file to be named **`HW4_Penelope_Pooler.Rmd`**
   
- Change title in the file header to be 'HW 4'
   
- Specify yourself as the author

<br>

**NOTES** 

- Provided header text below shows the correct format.

- This header text also creates a floating Table of Contents (toc).
   
```

title: "HW 4"
authors: "Penelope Pooler"
date: "Due 10/12/2022"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float: true
---

```

<br>

**`5.`** Modify the **`setup`** chunk 

- The **`setup`** chunk text shown below has packages and setup options for HW 4.

- Copy and paste text into the setup chunk of your HW 4 Markdown (**`.Rmd`**) file that you created from the provided template.
   
```

# this line specifies options for default options for all R Chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=T, highlight=T)

# suppress scientific notation
options(scipen=100)

# install helper package (pacman) if needed
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman", repos = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/")

# install and load required packages
# pacman should be first package in parentheses and then list others
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse, magrittr, gridExtra, lubridate, 
               knitr, kableExtra)

# verify packages 
p_loaded()

```

<br>

**`6.`** Click the green triangle or type Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter to run this setup chunk.

---

### HW 4 - Part 0

Examine `Export` and `Import` datasets from BLS

   - [Documentation on Import and Export Price Indixes](https://www.bls.gov/mxp/)

   - [Additional Documention provided by Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import-export-prices.asp)

   - Note number of rows to skip in `.csv` files

---

### HW 4 - Part 1

#### Chunk 2: Create `bls_tidy` function from provided code.

**`0.`** Remove `#` in front of `bls_tidy <- function(...){`
   and the following 2 lines.

**`1.`** Copy code from `read_csv(...` to `rename("unemp_rate" = "value")` and paste it within the body of the function.

Notice the three function inputs are:

- `data_file`
- `skip_num`
- `var_name`

<br>
    
**`2.`** Make the following replacements to turn the code used for one dataset into a function that can be used for any `bls` dataset.

- Replace the name of the dataset, `"bls_unemp_rate.csv"`, with the text, `data_file` (no quotes) in the `read_csv` command.

- Replace `11` with `skip_num` in the `read_csv` command.

- Replace the last line of the fuction with this line:
  - `rename({{var_name}} := "value")`
  
**NOTES:**  
 
- The `rename` command is modified to work within a function. 

- This command uses the `var_name` input.
 
<br>
  
**`3.`** Run the function code and examine the saved function by clicking on it in the Global Environment to verify it is correct.

**`4.`** Use the function to import the `"bls_unemp_rate.csv"` dataset and save it as `unemp`, by specifying these inputs with commas in between:

- `data_file = "bls_unemp_rate.csv", skip_num = 11, var_name = "unemp_rate"`


<br>


#### BB Question 1

Match each input of the `bls_tidy` function to the correct description.

-   `data_file =`

-   `skip_num =`

-   `var_name =`

<br>



#### BB Question 2

In this imported example dataset, the number of rows skipped (`skip_num`) was 11 rows and you can verify this by examining the `bls_unemp_rate.csv` file.

In the next part, we will use the `bls_tidy` function to import `bls_export_index.csv` and `bls_import_index.csv`.

Before doing that, examine these two data files in Excel to answer this question:

Fill in the blank:
 
-   `____` rows will need to be skipped when these two files are imported.

<br>

### HW 4 - Part 2

#### Chunk 3: Use function to import two datasets.

**`1.`** Run function to import `export_index.csv` and save it as `export_index`. For this dataset, the function inputs are:

- `data_file = "export_index.csv", skip_num = ____, var_name = "exp_indx"` 
   
- Replace the `____`with the answer from BB Question 2.

<br>

**`2.`**  Run function to import `import_index.csv` and save it as `import_index`.

- Replace the inputs to be appropriate for the `import_index` dataset

<br>

3.  Use `summary` to examine the numerical variable in each dataset.

- e.g. 
`summary(export_index$exp_indx)` 
 
**OR** 
`export_index |> pull(exp_indx) |> summary()`

<br>

#### BB Question 3

Each imported tidy dataset has

-   `____` observations

-   `____` variables

<br>

#### BB Question 4

Verify that two separate variables/datasets have been imported correctly.

You can examine datasets, by clicking on them in the `Global Environment` or by using the
`summary` command.

-   The minimum value of the export index, is `____`.

-   The maximum value of the export index is `____`.

-   The minimum value of the import index is `____`.

-   The maximum value of the import index is `____`.

---

### HW 4 - Part 3

#### Chunk 4: Join datasets and create date variable.

1.  Use `full_join` to create new dataset named `export_import` that includes

- `Year`

- `month`

- the export index variable, `exp_indx`

- the import index variable, `imp_indx`

- Note that because there are two matching variables in these two datasets, R will use those variables for the join by default.

<br> 

2.  Use `paste` and `ym` on the `Year` and `month` variables within a `mutate` command to create a `date` variable:

- `date = ym(paste(Year, month))`
 

**NOTES:**
    
- The command `paste` concatenates the characters from the `Year` and `month` variables, e.g. `2022 Jan`

- The command `ym` specifies that that `Year` (`y`) and `month` (`m`) in the pasted text will be converted to a date.

<br>


#### BB Question 5

What two variables are common to both datasets and used by R to do the full_join?

Enter variable names exactly as they appear in both datasets.

-   `____`

-   `____`


<br>


#### BB Question 6

As mentioned above, the `lubridate` command `ym` is able to create a `date` variable without day,
using only the `Year` and `month` variables in the data.

What **day** of the month does this created `date` variable show by default?

For example, the earliest `date` in the dataset is

-   `2012-01-____`.


---

### HW 4 - Part 4

#### Chunk 5: Reshape, format data for plot

Create a new dataset, `exp_imp_plt` and complete the following steps: 

** Use`select` to keep three variables: `date`, `exp_indx`,`imp_indx`  

**`2.`**  Use pivot_longer so that you have three columns:

- `date` column (already) 

- `index` column showing type of index, export or import

- `value` column showing value of export index or import index

<br>

**`3.`**  Convert index to a factor variable in a mutate statement with these levels and labels:

- `levels = c("exp_indx", "imp_indx")`

- `labels = c("Export", "Import")`

- Note that the same order must be used in the levels and labels options

---

### HW 4 - Part 5

#### Chunk 6: Create Formatted Line Plot

**`0.`** Remove `, eval = F` from header of Chunk 6

**`1.`** Create unformatted line plot with 2 lines: 1 line for each index:

- Replace `____` with name of reshaped data with `type` factor variable from previous
chunk.

- Complete `geom_line` command by adding aesthetic, `aes()`.

- Inside `aes()`: `x = date, y = value, color = type` 
  
- After `aes()`: add a comma and then specify `size = 1` to create thicker lines.

<br>

**`2.`** Add the following 4 options by follwing the `geom_line` command with a plus (`+`) and then adding a plus (`+`) after each option

```
theme_classic                                           # can opt for different theme

theme(legend.position="bottom")                         # moves legend to bottom
  
scale_color_manual(values=c("lightblue","blue"))        # specifies colors
                                                        # many other color options 
                                                  
scale_x_date(date_breaks = "year", date_labels = "%Y")  # formats x axis to show each year

```

<br>

**`3.`** Complete labs command using example plot below.

- All text should be in quotes.

- `color = ""` has been completed for you to supress label for legend.

- `title` and `subtitle` text are shown at the top.

- `x` and `y` axis labels are shown on the respective axes.

- NOTE: For `caption = ` Omit 2nd line.  Only need `Data Source: www.bls.gov`

### Example of Fully Formatted Line Plot: 

![](LinePlot_HW4_Penelope_Pooler.png)

---


#### BB Question 7:

Examine the plot and then fill in the blanks with the correct years:
NOte: Tick marks for years indicate the BEGINNING of each year.

-   The Import Price Index was higher than the Export Price Index from `____` to `____`.

-   The Import and Export Price Indices were approximately equal from `____` to `____`.

-   The Export Price Index has been higher than the Import Price Index since early `____`.
